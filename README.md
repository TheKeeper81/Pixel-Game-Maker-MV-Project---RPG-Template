# Pixel-Game-Maker-MV-Project---RPG-Template
This is a project file for the Pixel Game Maker MV engine. It's set up to work as a template for any role-playing games I decide to make with PGMMV.

The images were all made by me, TheKeeper, aka TheKeeper81. I originally created the body sprites for use with the RPG Maker engines. I wasn't very happy with the chibi characters and wanted sprites that looked more adult and fit in with the type of stories I tend to tell. So I initially got to work with pencil and paper, then traced and refined the work in Photoshop with the aid of my Wacom tablet. The body sprites were the result, and I'm rather pleased with them. I shared the male and female body sprites on DeviantArt. As the gender neutral body sprites were made a little afterwards, I've actually yet to make them available for download. If you like these sprites, feel free to use them in your own projects with any tool you please, be it RPG Maker, Pixel Game Maker, Unity, or what have you. The rest of the images I created were meant to be placeholders more than anything else--even the clothing and hair sprites. Replace with nicer artowrk as needed.

The sound effects were from OpenGameArt.org. The sound effects are as follows:

1) StarNinjas' 20 Sword Sound Effects (Attacks And Clashes).

2) Michel Baradari's 2 High Quality Explosions, submitted by qubodup.

3) ViRiX's UI SFX Pack 2 Sample. As per the instructions for use of these sound effects, I am including the following: Some of the sounds and/or music was created by David McKee (VIRiX Dreamcore)

The particle effects came from the built-in particle effect generator.

I have the following fonts installed:

1) Lora-Regular and Lora-Bold

2) Latin Modern Math (Note: I will be deleting this one from my project file, as the conversion to ttf did not play well with the maker, making this font not quite useful to me.)

As of this writing, this project file makes use of two 3rd party plugins:

1) kidthales' Linear Movement Plugin, which allows an object to move to a set of variable coordinates.

2) baz's MenuSceneMouse Plugin, which enables mouse functionality in one's games.

I used the following tutorials to create what I have so far:

1) PGMMV's built-in tutorial for a top-down game. Access by going to Help-->Tutorials and selecting the appropriate tutorial.

2) baz's Let's Make a Menu videos.

This template is currently a Work-In-Progress. In other words, it is not complete and is far from perfect. Indeed, as I make this template, I'm learning more and more about how the engine works, and since my understanding of PGMMVV is only rudimentary, you can be assured that there *will* be bugs. Hopefully, as I progress in my understanding of PGMMV, these bugs will become less and less prominent.

As of this current iteration, I have so far created a title menu, a character customization menu, an in-game main menu, and an inventory system. I'm in the process of making my own custom choices menu, as the Show Choices official plugin doesn't detect the mouse pointer. Hence, I have to create my own from scratch. So far, I've got everything working correctly, with one exception: When I move the player character either down the screen or to the right, the text for the choices moves out of alignment. I move down, the text creeps upward. I move right, and the text migrates left. I have yet to figure out the origin of this bug. I'm attempting to get some help from a couple of Discord PGMMV servers I'm a part of. Meanwhile, while I wait for a response, I'm going to play around with the settings and see what's causing the issue.

I created this RPG Template with the idea of playing it on the PC with mouse and keyboard. However, I've worked hard to make the game as controller-friendly as possible. I'm not quite sure if I succeeded in that quite yet, but I'm working on it.

As of this writing, the controls are as follows:

OK/Confirmation Button = Left Mouse Button

CANCEL Button = ESC key

A Button = Left Mouse Button

B Button = Right Mouse Button

X Button = O Key (Not Zero)

Y Button = I Key

R1 = Middle Mouse Scroll Down

L1 = Middle Mouse Scroll Up

R2 = Spacebar

L2 = E key

To attack, press the A/Left Mouse Button.

To scroll through the hotbar slots, use R1 and L1/Middle Mouse Scroll Down and Up. To activate the item in the hotbar, either use the B/Right Mouse Button or, alternatively on the keyboard, use the shortcut keys 1 and 2.

To bring up the main in-game menu, press the Y Button/I key.

To scroll through the inventory slots, use the R2 and L2 Buttons/Spacebar and R keys. To activate the item in the inventory slot, use the OK/Left Mouse Button. You will be presented with some choices as to what you can do with the items.

To move the inventory objects around to the hotbar or to the inventory slots:

Mouse and Keyboard: Left Click on the inventory object and hold down the O key, then drag to desired slot.

Controller: Push the Right Stick in the direction you want the inventory object to move, then press the X Button. The inventory object should begin moving. Use the Rightt Stick to steer the object to the desired slot.

I believe those are all the controls for now. These are subject to change as I update the template.
